						<h2 About Pinkie</h2>
						<p> Thanks for checking out my site! I am a San Francisco Bay Area, CA based environmental professional. I grew up in the East Bay Area, where large natural spaces are easily accessible. As a result, I have always been interested in studying and understanding our environment. I received my Bachelor's degree in Geology with an Environmental Science Focus from Occidental College in Los Angeles. As a project geologist, I gained field experience working on Phase II and III Environmental Site Assessments. I transitioned to STEM education as a Public Education Specialist at the Lawrence Hall of Science, UC Berkeley before joining the Watershed Project as their Youth Field Crew Manager. I am currently enrolled in Cal Poly Humboldt’s Geospatial Certificate program, and expected to complete the program in July 2023. In my free time, if I’m not dusting off my rock collection, I like to knit and bike on the Bay Area Bay Trail.</p>
